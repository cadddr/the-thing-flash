### Code like it's 2012!

Came across this poorly made little game with embarrassing visuals that I hacked together almost a decade ago, when I was started grad school (hard to believe this was my original dissertation idea!). Anyway, the core mechanic turns out suprisingly solid and the game is actually playable -- even offers some fun to be had. Also, neatly comes with a history of some 60 commits. Thought I'd give it some minimal polish to hopefully make worthy of sharing. Stay tuned for updates coming  2030ish :laughing:
